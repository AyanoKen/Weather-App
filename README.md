# Weather App

A flutter project to get the weather of a location

## Getting Started

One would require an openweathermap api key for the project to work. The key is free and anyone can get anyone can get one by signing up.

create a dart file under lib/utilities and name it "keys.dart"

After creating the file, paste the following code in it -> const kApiKey = (Your api key);

That would be good enough for the app to start working.
